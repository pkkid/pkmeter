# PKMeter - Desktop System Monitor
PySide6/Python app to display system stats and meters on your desktop. Plugin
system allows creating new meters quickly. I believe the following features are
what makes this app different from the other solutions out there:
* Quickly create new plugins with Python.
* Simple HTML template system.
* Prefrences set in the app (not cmd line scripts).
* Available for Windows and Linux
